📌 Task-04 | Prodigy Infotech Internship

This project is an application-level keylogger developed for educational and cybersecurity learning purposes.
It captures and logs keystrokes only within the application window and saves them to a log file with timestamps.

⚠️ It does NOT record system-wide keystrokes.

🎯 Objective

To understand how keyboard events can be captured, processed, and securely logged within a controlled environment while maintaining ethical standards and user privacy.

🧠 Key Features

Logs keystrokes typed inside the application only

Records timestamped input

Handles special keys (ENTER, SPACE, BACKSPACE)

Saves logs to a text file

Simple and beginner-friendly GUI

Ethical and permission-based design

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Tkinter (GUI)

File Handling

Datetime module

▶️ How It Works

The application opens a GUI window.

User types inside the input field.

Each keystroke is captured using keyboard events.

Keys are logged with timestamps in key_log.txt.
